## Documentation

A documentation can be built using [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/). To build it, run:

    ../path/to/jsdoc -c conf.json

## TODO

- Clean all things storing them by scope
- Give each scope a "good" name
- Define a preset for each file and then a "scope" preset with only dependencies
- Find a performant "include()" system
